					<p> My diploma year was the toughest yet memorable moments that has happened in my life. It is the 
						place where I need to leave my family to further study. On entering university, there is absolutely 
						no way I would have imagined the things I have done, the experiences I have had, the incredible people I have met, 
						and all that I have achieved. I learned a lot of things druing my diploma
						year such as to be independent and boost my confidence level.
						I am currently in my last year with <strong>3.85 CGPA</strong> and I hope I can graduate soon and make my parents proud. </p>
